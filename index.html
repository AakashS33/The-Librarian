                <p>This weeks book discussion features <b>Ready Player Two</b> which is a 2020 science fiction novel by
                    American author <b>Ernest Cline</b>. It is the sequel to his 2011 debut novel Ready Player One.

                <p style="font-size: 120%"><u>Discussion</u> <u>Mystery/Horror</u> Are Stephen King’s endings really that bad?</p>
                <p>I’ve read The Long Walk, Pet Sematary, Needful Things, and Thinner.
                    Out of those the only one that had a whacked out ending that I felt was out of place was Needful
                    Things. That being said I haven’t read a lot of his bigger stuff like IT or The Shining. I did see
                    the movies but from what I understand quite a bit was changed? Curious to hear from folks who’ve
                    read him far more than I if that statement is true in your opinion about his endings being pretty bad.</p>

                <p style="font-size: 120%"><u>Discussion</u> <u>Fiction</u> What ending would you give Frankenstein?</p>
                <p>I just read the book. Victor is a poignant, depressing spoilt rich guy. The monster, though capable
                    of benevolence, chooses to kill. I understand the book is supposed to warn against unnatural
                    sciences and the perils of untamed ambition.
                    It's just that the ending was so sad. There is no 'good guy'. Or is that the point of the book,
                    that duality exists? I'm just wondering if an alternate ending is possible, one where some good prevails</p>

                <p>Just finished the book, and I honestly do not know what to think about it. The last few pages was just
                    an analysis of human power and how they defined it. Pierre was also planning a rebellion. My book
                    is old, so I might have lost a few pages but can someone give me some insight as to what happened to
                    the rebellion that was being planned</p>
